# DLS-OnlineOptimiser

DLS-Online Optimiser is a package used to perform online multi-objective optimistaion of the diamond light source synchotron machine. A flexible program is provided in order to choose parameters and objectives for optimisation, as well as a selection of versatile algorithms. These include:

- Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimiser (MOPSO)
- Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA)
- Multi-Objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)
- Single-Objective Robust Conjugate Direction Search (RCDS)

Run OnlinePackage/basic/main.py in a dls-python environment in order to start the program.
